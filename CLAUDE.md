# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

An open-source, community-driven knowledge base documenting real experiences
building AI-agent workflows with open-source tools. The value is in honest
failure reports and working configs — not polished theory. Born from a real
n8n marketing automation project at Dot.ID.

This is a **pure Markdown repository** — no build system, no package manager,
no tests. All work is writing, editing, and committing `.md` files.

> Note: `CLAUDE-ajk.md` in the root belongs to a different project (LLM Council)
> and does not describe this repository.

## Content Architecture

### Three Content Types

**Case Studies** (`case-studies/`)
End-to-end stories structured as: goal → tools tried (in order) → failures →
working solution. Each attempt has its own "Why we tried it / How we set it up /
What happened / Verdict" block. Numbered sequentially (`001`, `002`, …).
Use `case-studies/TEMPLATE.md` as the canonical starting point.

**Tool Pages** (`tools/`)
Single-tool reference pages. Structure: what it is → why people try it →
the problem or gotcha → working config or fix → alternatives. One file per tool,
named after the tool (`n8n-ce.md`, `wordpress-media.md`, etc.).

**Lessons** (`lessons/`)
Cross-cutting principles extracted from multiple case studies. Structure: the
principle stated plainly → why it bites people → the safe pattern or fix →
verification steps. These generalize beyond any single tool.

### Cross-Linking Convention

Every entry links to related files using **relative Markdown paths**:
- From `case-studies/` → `../tools/tool-name.md` or `../lessons/lesson-name.md`
- From `tools/` → `../case-studies/NNN-slug.md` or `../lessons/lesson-name.md`
- From `lessons/` → `../case-studies/NNN-slug.md` or `../tools/tool-name.md`

Always add a `## Related` or `## See Also` section at the bottom of every entry.

## Key Design Decisions

### Failure-First Framing
Every case study documents the failed attempts in full detail before the working
solution. The failure section is the most valuable part — it must include the
exact error message, the symptom (especially silent failures), and what made the
problem hard to debug. "It didn't work" is not a failure report.

### Verdict Icons — Three Only
All evaluations use exactly one of these, no variations:
- `✅ Worked`
- `⚠️ Partial`
- `❌ Failed`

### Sequential Case Study Numbering
Case studies use zero-padded three-digit prefixes (`001`, `002`, …). Check the
highest existing number before creating a new file. Tool pages and lessons are
not numbered — they're named after their topic.

### TODO Stubs Over Omissions
If a section can't be filled in (e.g. an error wasn't fully captured), write a
`> TODO: describe the exact error here` block rather than leaving the section
empty or removing it. Stubs invite community contributions; gaps look like the
section was forgotten.

## Privacy Rules (Public Repo)

Content is often drawn from internal projects. Strip the following before committing:

| Strip | Replace with |
|---|---|
| Private server domains / IPs | `your-server.com` |
| Numeric user IDs in table names (`u42_vectors`) | Pattern form (`u{user_id}_vectors`) |
| Email addresses with product/company names | "system account" or omit |
| Client names | omit |
| Pricing figures | omit |
| Private GitHub repo URLs | omit |

**Keep:** version numbers, exact error messages, CLI commands, timing data,
architecture patterns, model IDs, API endpoint paths.

## Common Gotchas

### Cross-links break if slugs change
File renames break every `../tools/old-name.md` link in the repo. Grep for the
old name before renaming: `grep -r "old-name" .`

### TEMPLATE.md must stay complete
`case-studies/TEMPLATE.md` is the source of truth for the case study format.
If you change the format in existing entries, update the template to match so
new contributors follow the right structure.

### Verdict in the tool page header vs. body
The first line of every tool page sets context with a one-line verdict:
```
**Verdict:** ✅ Worked — reliable public image host for social media automation
```
This is separate from per-attempt verdicts inside case studies. Don't conflate them.

## Commit Message Convention

```
add: <short description>        # new file(s)
update: <tool or case study>    # editing existing content
fix: <what was wrong>           # typo / broken link / factual correction
```

## Content Flow Summary

```
Real experience (internal project)
    ↓
Sanitize (strip private details — see Privacy Rules)
    ↓
Choose content type:
    Case study → copy TEMPLATE.md → NNN-slug.md
    Tool page  → tools/tool-name.md
    Lesson     → lessons/lesson-name.md
    ↓
Fill all sections (use > TODO for gaps, don't omit)
    ↓
Add ## Related / ## See Also with relative cross-links
    ↓
Commit (add:/update:/fix: prefix) → push to master
    ↓
GitHub release (gh release create vX.Y.Z) for significant milestones
```
